Here is an example in how you to run.
In this example I'm starting a diary to the *myapp* folder, when is not provided a name for the subtopic the current
day will be the final name
```
$ shipslogs myapp 
```

Using this instance a name is provided to be the subtopic, in this case "example" id going to be the suptopic created
```
$ shipslogs myapp example
```
