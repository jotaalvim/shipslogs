# ðŸ›³ ship's log
The original idea was born in an hackaton in 2020, this new version, ship's logs, is an 
improvement of the original [DiÃ¡rio de Bordo](https://github.com/lumafepe/hackathon20-21).

``shipslog`` is an app that enable us to **keep a record of printcreens** we make during an event such as a talk, metting, online class. When you reach the end of your task a pdf (or other file extension specified) will be created whith every print you took. It's possible to **extract the text from your printscreen** to the output diary file by having 'ocr' whithin your printscreen name when saving it. This feature is usefull when someone is presenting you some text that you need to get on your side.

### Usage
Uses the current day as the default name to the subtopic where the output is going to be generated


Simpler call is done by only providing the parent folder, in this case we'll be generated a a new folder with 
the current day


only one diary per subtopic
```
$ shipslogs <parent_folder> 
```

```
$ shipslogs <parent_folder> <sub_topic>
```

### Config

config.json


### Options
* -h, help

* -t <pathInput> <pathOutput>, from a given input path to a folder of images, "transcripts" the images to a new diary in the
output path

### Outputs

Here is an example in how you to run.

day will be the final name

$ shipslogs myapp 
```

Using this instance a name is provided to be the subtopic, in this case "example" id going to be the suptopic created
```
